# Repository Description:  

**Chatbot with Blenderbot and Flask**  

This project involves creating a simple chatbot using Facebook's **Blenderbot** model, implemented with the **Transformers** library by Hugging Face.  

The main goal of the project was to build a functional chatbot for the terminal and then integrate it into a web interface. **Flask** was used as the back-end framework, enabling the development of an interactive web application where users can communicate with the chatbot.  

## Features:
- Implementation of **Blenderbot** for an AI-based chatbot.  
- Development of a command-line interface for initial testing.  
- Integration of the chatbot into a web application using **Flask**.  
- Server hosted locally or in a cloud environment.  

This project combines essential skills in Python development, natural language processing, and web application creation, serving as an excellent introduction to leveraging pre-trained models and integrating them into user-friendly interfaces.
